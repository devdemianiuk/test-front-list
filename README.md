# What did need to do
* list of offers
* filter this list
* mobile first approach

# What can be better (I put it here FYI)

* formFactor feature that allows components and services knows about current size and dynamic change the shown component
* scss mixtures and functions which help build a media query faster and obviously
* also using scss variables to all resolution
* using effect
* use mapping to get access to props faster and keep view separately from data
* use atomic css
* add unit tests to be sure data is rendered in component
* add unit tests to be sure reducers works as expected
* add i18n
* add barrel
* and so on... Many things to improve

# Why I did something

* have only a couple of hours for this task and no design
* don't wrote test
* add only one filter (other will add in the same way)
